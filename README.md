## Finnish Public Domain texts

This is a small collection of texts that are written in Finnish and are explicitly released into Public Domain. The texts are available in various locations online. In order to keep the Public Domain status of these works entirely clear, no references to the third parties are made, besides the National Library of Finland's [Classics Library](http://www.doria.fi/handle/10024/91449) project, which contains books from Finland that are in Public Domain. The inclusion of books into this collection is used to define and ensure that these works are legally in Public Domain.

Possible uses of texts are OCR Ground Truth creation for early modern Finnish, and there are also plans to add them into Mozilla's Common Voice project. More on that below!

## Common Voice

[Common Voice](https://voice.mozilla.org/fi) is Mozilla's project that creates an entirely openly available speech dataset that can be used to any purpose. For that we need Public Domain sentences. We have translated the interface, and are currently in sentence validation and collection phase. We would need 5000–10,000 sentences, and several persons have to vote that each sentence is valid before it can be accepted. We have now bit over 3000 sentences, so there is still work to do.

If you got this far, please go to check the sentence collector, and if you want, validate or add some new sentences: [common-voice.github.io/sentence-collector](common-voice.github.io/sentence-collector)
